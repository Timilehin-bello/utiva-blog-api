# Utiva Blog API

This is a standard README document to help you set up an already developed Node.js and Express application. Below are the steps to get the application up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd <project_folder>
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   If you are using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   If you are using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

## Configuration

1. Locate the configuration files:

 Create a .env file, check the .env.example to confirm the variables that are necessary in the .env file


## Running the Application

Once the setup and configuration are complete, you can start the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The above command will start the Node.js server, and you should see a message indicating that the server is running. By default, the application might run on `http://localhost:3000`. Open your browser and navigate to this address to access the application.



## Contact

If you need further assistance or have any questions, you can contact the project maintainers via email or through other communication channels specified in the repository.
